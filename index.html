<p>
System Metrics is a Rails 3 Engine that provides a clean web interface to the 
performance metrics instrumented with ActiveSupport::Notifications. It will collect
and display the notifications baked into Rails and any additional custom ones you add 
using ActiveSupport::Notification#instrument.
